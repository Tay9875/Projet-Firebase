## Comments
It's always good to have a criticle opinion about your own projects so if I had to make some comments, I'd say that though it needs a bit more organizing (code structure) and less redudant functions and ligns, I'm overall very happy with how it turned out for a project that I did alone, and only hope to improve.

One functionality that would of been a very useful one is unfortunately lacking because I couldn't quite figure out how to code it in the amout of time I had, so I hope to figure that out in the future.

This is the first project where I made a chat system, which, though it was quite hair rippingly annoying some times was still very fun to do once I worked through it. So to see it completed feels like one of the biggest achievements of the project.
